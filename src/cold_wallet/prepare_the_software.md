# Prepare the software
In the next few steps we'll be taking our device offline _forever_, so we'll be making sure that we have _everything_ we need installed here, beforehand.

Most notably, we need wallet software - we'll be using [Monero GUI](https://www.getmonero.org/downloads) in this guide.

Other wallets that support offline transactions can be used (e.g Monero CLI) however the steps may slightly differ.

## 💾 Install

<strong>Note:</strong> if <a href="../optional/physical_security.md#-disk-encryption">full disk encryption</a> is desired, that step should be done before any of this, as it cannot easily done after the fact.

Make sure your wallet software is installed on your cold device.

If you are using the cold device for purposes [in addition to Monero](../before_we_start/before_we_start.md), you should make that software is installed as well.

## 🔏 Verify

While this last step is technically optional, you are strongly encouraged to verify your wallet's authenticity before usage.

There are steps specific to Monero GUI [here](https://web.getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/verification-windows-beginner.html). More details can be found on the [downloads](https://getmonero.org/downloads) page.
