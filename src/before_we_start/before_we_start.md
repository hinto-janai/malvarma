At the end of this guide, you will be in possession of an [air-gapped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_gap_(networking)) computer.

For the purposes of this guide, we focus on how to use that computer to create and sign offline Monero transactions, however, there are other practical usecases this computer could serve, e.g:

- Other offline cryptocurrency transaction signing
- Offline password vault ([KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org), [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com), [1Password](https://1password.com), etc)
- Offline [OTP/2FA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) generation
- Offline PGP message signing

In short, this air-gapped computer is viable for storing any "secret" that would be better stored offline, and is not just limited to Monero.
