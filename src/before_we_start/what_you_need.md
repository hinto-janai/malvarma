# What you need
1. Computer (Laptop, Desktop, SBC, etc)
2. Data transfer medium (USB, SD Card, etc)
3. Screwdriver

This computer will never connect to the internet ever again, so make sure you okay with "sacrificing" it into a cold wallet.

You will also need a computer _other_ than this cold computer to act as your `view-only` wallet (perhaps the computer you're using to read this guide?). The security of this computer does not matter as much, as it will not be able to spend any funds.

## ðŸ’» This guide

This guide will assume you are using:
- **A laptop** as your computer
- **Monero GUI** as your wallet
- **Windows** as your OS

The instructions will differ with other types of computers/wallets/OS's, but they are _mostly_ the same.

In our case - we'll be using the cheapest 2nd-hand laptop we could quickly find ($80).
