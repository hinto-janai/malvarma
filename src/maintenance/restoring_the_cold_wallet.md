# Restoring the cold wallet
If you are restoring your cold wallet on a new machine, you must follow the steps in [`Outputs`](../transactions/outputs.md) once again, such that your cold wallet can see true amount of funds it can spend.

Simply re-follow the steps and your cold wallet will be ready to sign future transactions.
