# Upgrading the wallet
Sometimes, Monero goes through backwards-incompatible [hard-fork upgrades](https://www.getmonero.org/2022/04/20/network-upgrade-july-2022.html).

Sometimes, wallets receive important security updates.

In both of these cases, you will need to upgrade your cold wallet software.

As your air-gapped machine cannot connect to any network, you'll be using the same method you have used throughout this guide to upgrade your cold wallet: **the data transfer medium**.

Go through the steps of [`Prepare the software`](../cold_wallet/prepare_the_software.md) again, this time, transferring the new wallet software to your data transfer medium, then that to your cold wallet.

Replace the wallet software, and now you have an updated cold wallet.
